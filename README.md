Odoo SEO Optimization.
This Odoo Module is used to integrate Odoo With Google analytics. While Odoo have it's own way to connect to Google analytics,
sometimes we might want to connect that information with the lead we already have in Odoo. This module will collect all the data
recorded by google analytics and connect it to the lead recorded by Odoo. Since both have there own unique information linking them 
will produce much bigger data to work with.
